Welcome to this workshop where we are going to dive into a core active directory component - Kerberos!

This lab is a self-guided Active Directory security exercise designed to help participants understand Kerberos-based privilege escalation attacks. Originally part of a SANS workshop, this lab is now freely available for local deployment on VMware, VirtualBox, and Ludus.

Participants will build their own AD lab, configure attack tools, and execute real-world attack techniques to escalate privileges in an Active Directory environment.

This workshop is ideally suited for blue teamers that want to peek behind the curtain and understand how adversaries attack AD and pentesters that may not be as familiar with AD environments yet.

Attacks Covered
üîπ Kerberoasting ‚Äì Extracting service tickets to crack passwords
üîπ DCSyncing ‚Äì Extracting credentials by simulating a domain controller
üîπ SID History Abuse ‚Äì Hopping across parent/child domain trusts
üîπ Unconstrained Delegation Abuse ‚Äì Capturing privileged credentials

### Note

Note: The following labs are related only to the usage of Empire & Starkiller and no other tools
